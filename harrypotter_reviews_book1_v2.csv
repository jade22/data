Lora ,5,"I'm going to keep this brief since there isn't much to say that hasn't already been said. *clears throat*
I think the reason I waited so long to read this series is because I just couldn't imagine myself enjoying reading about an eleven-year-old boy and his adventures at a school of wizardry. I thought it would be too juvenile for my taste. I was wrong, of course.
I can honestly say that I loved every minute of this. It's a spectacular little romp with funny, courageous, and endearing characters that you can't help but love.
It has talking chess pieces, singing hats, a giant three-headed dog named Fluffy, a hilarious giant with a dragon fetish, a master wizard that's just a little bit crazy, mail carrier owls, goblins running a bank, unicorns, centaurs(!), trolls . . . and probably much more that I'm forgetting.
And then there's the lead characters: Hermione, the young scholar who starts out prim and up-tight but soon becomes a true friend; Ron, the boy who has little money but who has an abundance of family and loyalty to his friends to make up for it; and then there's Harry, the boy who starts out sleeping in a closet and ends up being a hero. Harry is kind to those that deserve it, fearless when it counts the most, and wonderfully intelligent. What's not to love?

In regards to the ending: (view spoiler)

FAVORITE QUOTE: ""But from that moment on, Hermione Granger became their friend. There are some things you can't share without ending up liking each other, and knocking out a twelve-foot mountain troll is one of them.""

Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm off to start Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets."
Zoë ,5,I will never ever rate this lower than 5 stars. BEAUTIFUL.
Sasha Alsberg,5,Why the heck did I not read Harry Potter before now...its flipping magical (literally)!
Jayson ,4,"(A-) 83% | Very Good
Notes: Despite a weak climax, it's a delightful read: an excellent introduction to its richly layered, wildly imaginative world."
Harold Bloom ,1,"Can 35 Million Book Buyers Be Wrong? Yes.

Taking arms against Harry Potter, at this moment, is to emulate Hamlet taking arms against a sea of troubles. By opposing the sea, you won't end it. The Harry Potter epiphenomenon will go on, doubtless for some time, as J. R. R. Tolkien did, and then wane.

The official newspaper of our dominant counter-culture, The New York Times, has been startled by the Potter books into establishing a new policy for its not very literate book review. Rather than crowd out the Grishams, Clancys, Crichtons, Kings, and other vastly popular prose fictions on its fiction bestseller list, the Potter volumes will now lead a separate children's list. J. K. Rowling, the chronicler of Harry Potter, thus has an unusual distinction: She has changed the policy of the policy-maker.

Imaginative Vision

I read new children's literature, when I can find some of any value, but had not tried Rowling until now. I have just concluded the 300 pages of the first book in the series, ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone,"" purportedly the best of the lot. Though the book is not well written, that is not in itself a crucial liability. It is much better to see the movie, ""The Wizard of Oz,"" than to read the book upon which it was based, but even the book possessed an authentic imaginative vision. ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"" does not, so that one needs to look elsewhere for the book's (and its sequels') remarkable success. Such speculation should follow an account of how and why Harry Potter asks to be read.

The ultimate model for Harry Potter is ""Tom Brown's School Days"" by Thomas Hughes, published in 1857. The book depicts the Rugby School presided over by the formidable Thomas Arnold, remembered now primarily as the father of Matthew Arnold, the Victorian critic-poet. But Hughes' book, still quite readable, was realism, not fantasy. Rowling has taken ""Tom Brown's School Days"" and re-seen it in the magical mirror of Tolkein. The resultant blend of a schoolboy ethos with a liberation from the constraints of reality-testing may read oddly to me, but is exactly what millions of children and their parents desire and welcome at this time.

In what follows, I may at times indicate some of the inadequacies of ""Harry Potter."" But I will keep in mind that a host are reading it who simply will not read superior fare, such as Kenneth Grahame's ""The Wind in the Willows"" or the ""Alice"" books of Lewis Carroll. Is it better that they read Rowling than not read at all? Will they advance from Rowling to more difficult pleasures?

Rowling presents two Englands, mundane and magical, divided not by social classes, but by the distinction between the ""perfectly normal"" (mean and selfish) and the adherents of sorcery. The sorcerers indeed seem as middle-class as the Muggles, the name the witches and wizards give to the common sort, since those addicted to magic send their sons and daughters off to Hogwarts, a Rugby school where only witchcraft and wizardry are taught. Hogwarts is presided over by Albus Dumbeldore as Headmaster, he being Rowling's version of Tolkein's Gandalf. The young future sorcerers are just like any other budding Britons, only more so, sports and food being primary preoccupations. (Sex barely enters into Rowling's cosmos, at least in the first volume.)

The first half of a little piece I wrote from the Journal in July 2000. Rest is available at [http://wrt-brooke.syr.edu/courses/205...]."
Amanda Patterson ,1,"These books terrify me.
They are badly written and they have plots that don't make sense.
Read Artemis Fowl instead. Please!
Anybody who tells me that they have only read Harry Potter and / or The Da Vinci Code scares me even more.
That statement will keep me away from the books and away from the people who read them."
Bria,1,"You're a wimp Harry.

Harry is the perfect bland character that the reader can feel at home with. He does not have any talents that anyone would be jealous of or feel threatened by. He is not overly attractive, tall, muscular, athletic, intelligent, coordinated, over-the-top, brave, confident, knowledgeable or talented. In fact he doesn't have any hobbies or interests to speak of when he is first introduced. He is completely and totally average.

But here is the kicker, even though he is totally average, everybody knows his name and his fame has spread throughout the magical world. This is easily every kid's dream. To not have to work or be talented, and still be gifted with this intense fame and notoriety. It's a perfect bed-time story that you would tell a small child and could easily be replaced with, ""Sammy you are such a special little boy and everyone saw how special you were right away. The whole world knew Sammy's name and just how special he was.""

Not only is Harry well-known but is always under the media's eye and captures headmaster's (and other people of power) interest. Another testament to his 'specialness'. Harry's character reaches into the childish need of people to be recognized for their talents that they already possess, not for working hard or striving for improvement of these talents. We want to be praised for just being ourselves! Harry also can do whatever he wants and go into the blocked off areas of campus. This feeds another childish need, the need to explore and be bad and see if you will get reprimanded. However Harry is never reprimanded, in fact he is praised for his behavior. He is so 'special' that even when he is being bad and not following the rules, it's because he has picked up clues that no one else but him, a child, can see. He is quite literally the 'the one and only'. As a reader this is enticing! How amazing would it be to be Harry! To not have to work or study or earn these adventures, but simply through your birth and by being yourself, you were given these adventures and have a different set of rules than everybody else! As Harry, you are prized and one-of-a-kind.

However everyone has to experience some hardship and Harry is given his by being left as an orphan. Another childish dream come true! Who needs nasty parents that always ruin your fun? (Disney agrees. Parents affect the plot line too much). Naturally this works out well for Harry. It gives him a pitiful, depressive attitude and buckets of money. Now he has money, no one to stop him or set rules for him as he goes gallivanting off to fight the Big Evil. It also gives him a chip on his shoulder that the reader can sympathize with. Without this sympathy Harry would just be an average kid who won the lottery and got to practice magic at a cool school, but since he is an ORPHAN that won the lottery and practices magic the reader feels bad for him and works even harder to like him and feel connected to him. To put the cherry on the top, little rich magical Harry is forced to live in a nice home with stupid people. They don't beat him but instead refuse to give him gifts and make him feel more average and like a weirdo. What reader hasn't felt like a weirdo in their life? This struggle is the final connection to Harry and the reader is drawn in hook line and sinker.

Although Harry consistently moans about his loneliness he has a close knit group of friends that would give their life for him. In order to make up for Harry's average self his friends possess more talents, cleverness and influence than him. The headmaster has power, Hermione has intelligence, Ron has strength and a place for Harry to stay/family, and Hagrid has information and access to the school. Therefore Harry is lifted from the burden of ever having to improve himself because he has amassed friends that can help him in any situation. Score. However average Harry is having a hard time making friends at school due to jealousy. It seems oh so strange that people would dare to jealous of little rich magical famous Harry. In order to combat this jealousy Harry easily discovers that his does have a hidden talent: flying on a broomstick! It was locked in his DNA (thanks Dad!) and needed no training or experience to work perfectly. Now he has one claim to fame that the other kids can admire instead of be jealous of! Since he will fly on the Hogworts team he is now an asset to the student body. Yay Harry! You have succeeded without work again! However these team practices are often too much of a commitment for Harry so he finds many excuses to miss them. Since he is such a favorite, the team agrees.

But Harry has run into some trouble. It seems that his refusal to be friends with a rude boy has led to ever-lasting hatred! Poor Draco is given no depth besides that of a preppy little twat. Harry can't fight someone more interesting or pitiful than him so it's better that Draco has no personality or any excuse for the reader to like him. We wouldn't want to forget about Harry!

But what is the point of having powerful friends, magic, money and fame if you have no one to share them with? Big relief, Harry is poised to fight the Big Evil! It seems that he is the only one who can do it, not because of his own merit of course. It's because his mother was so amazing that she wrapped him in her love like armor. Harry is the most well-loved orphan of all time! Step aside Annie. Good thing you have armor Harry, it would be very boring for the reader to hear about how you had to train and exert yourself to defeat the Big Evil. That is also something the reader has a hard time relating to. After all, the reader has never been in an epic fight with magic. Also it would ruin the whole childish appeal of the novel if Harry didn't have some secret way of defeating the Big Evil. This secret way is easily accessible and coveted. Instead of a sword or an amulet, Harry has feelings and everybody has feelings so we all can stop the Big Evil! Thanks for involving the reader Harry!

I hope by this part in the review you have recognized my sarcasm. If not, feel free to re-read.

Harry, the epitome of our Facebook, Twitter, fame-ridden dreams has also recently become the center of many new college courses. What a better place to study average Harry than a place of knowledge! To achieve the full experience of understanding and becoming Harry, colleges now offer clubs where you too can play on a broom! *These clubs vary in their descriptions, see a college catalogue for assistance* Also once you sign up for a Harry class be sure to pick up the pamphlet for the next new class, scheduled right after Harry, for white privilege! Don't let this juxtaposition fool you. It is natural to be interested and obsessed with both topics. Although Harry is a white, rich, famous male he is an orphan that experienced some mild bulling so there is no way he could fall underneath this new buzzword category of 'white privilege'. If this confuses you, please rant on FaceBook about it."
Sabrina,2,"After billions of years, I finally read this book and I came to the conclusion that I would have liked this more if I had read it at a younger age."
Nina,5,"My second-favorite part of this series! I've read all the books about 6 to 7 times now and whenever I reread them the parts in which Harry finds out that he's a wizard and learns about the wizarding world make me feel like I'm new to this world as well! :)

2018 REREAD: I still love this book so much! Also, I finally read the illustrated version of the book and it’s absolutely beautiful!"
Ginger,2,"I want to like the Harry Potter novels, I really do.

After years of trying to stay away, I finally dove in.

I will say this, I suspect that a great many of the adults who are reading HP books are really far more in love with the setting than the actual stories themselves. I adore the thought of a snowy, cozy boarding school with feasts and friends and dusty old curriculum.

But, as a former educator who still reads a LOT of children's fiction there is MUCH BETTER out there, friends. Much better. I find the story oversimplified, even on a child's level, and I don't find the plots and themes a little hollow.

The characters are charming enough I suppose, and I believe this is why they are so popular.

I'm going to keep slogging through the series, because I want to be clued in on such a pop culture phenomenon, but HP just isn't my cup."
Krystal,4,"Once upon a time, there was a girl who hated Harry Potter.

I was a massive LOTR geek, and I think I was a little offended that HP blew up so big when masterpieces like LOTR were overlooked. Plus, I saw the first film and it sucked, so it was easy to hate. I refused to read the series on principle.

Then one of my close friends gave me her old, battered copy of this book, with a heartwarming note. In it, she said she was gifting me her copy, because she wanted to share something that was really important to her. HP was the book that got her into reading, and it had consequently led her to LOTR - the very thing we had bonded over. She implored me to read the book that had been partially responsible for our friendship.

That's right, folks: I was bribed into reading this.

Now, here comes the hard part, where I admit how grateful I am to her. I was hooked instantly and read the entire series one after the other. And ... okay ... YES ... I even enjoyed it a little bit.

So.

Now, 12 years later, I'm re-reading with the intention of reviewing from a more objective perspective. So here we go.

I have to give props to this series for what it has done for the world of literature. I'm sure my friend wasn't the only one converted into a reader by this series. As much as I hate to admit it, there are a lot of people who have been inspired to do wonderful things thanks to this series. So kudos for that.

Gotta also give JK an A+ for world building. This stuff is brilliant fantasy, because there's so much going on and even with it's simplicity it has created a solid world of magic that kids (and adults) want to be a part of. This level of creativity inspires the soul and just makes for a fantastic read.

The writing is appropriate for a children's story, but still interesting enough to keep us big kids entertained. This book is about escapism and that's relatable to many, I should think. It's probably the main reason these books are so popular.

Characters ... well.

Even with my retraction of hatred for the series, I will never have a soft spot for Harry. To this day he stands as one of my least favourite characters of all time. Honestly, you'd think some of that time being abused by his family would have humbled him a little, but instead he's an arrogant smart ass who kinda treats people like crap. He and Ron were actually horrendous to Hermione until that troll incident. So Harry will live on as a jerk in my memory. I know he's just a kid, but still. And I also know that this is aimed at kids. But, damn, it makes an absolute sham of abuse. No kid would come out of a life like that and have a tongue as sharp as Harry's. That kid is way too stuck up for a kid who was always treated as though he were worthless. I know, I am a horrible person. I've kind of come to terms with it, these days.

Other characters?

I like Hermione's brilliance and how she stands up for what she believes. I like Ron's sarcasm and brutal honesty. I like Neville's awkwardness, and Malfoy's pathetic attempts to be evil. And I love Snape being a dick to Harry because he kinda deserves it. Dumbledore seems like an incredibly irresponsible headmaster, but lucky McGonagall is there to keep everything up to scratch. Quirrell's a weirdo.

The plot of this one is simple and rollicks along at a decent pace, particularly when you consider that this is the introductory novel. It's actually written pretty damn well to do all that world-building, keep it fast paced, and still be able to hold the interest of adults and children alike.

So yeah, I may not really like JK, or HP, but I can respect this book for what it is, and appreciate the magic of it. I guess I kind of actually love it a little, after all.

Original delayed review:

Okay I'm going to amend my one star to three, simply in light of the fact that this was actually okay for a children's book. It's full of creativity - diverse characters, magic, madness - and is a great little adventure for young ones. I think the problem for me with this whole series is that it started out with this fantastic children's book, but as it became of interest to older readers, so the writing style changed. You really had to grow up with the series, because the same kids that are reading this book should not be reading the horrors that come later in the series.

But I'm going to try and review these books objectively.

This first book introduces us to the magical world of Hogwarts, which psychologists would have a field day with, since it's such a contrast to the life Harry is escaping. He goes from being this despised child amongst family to being the hero of the school. I personally like to think that the whole Hogwarts adventure is really Harry's psychotic break, as he rocks back and forth in his little cupboard under the stairs. Anyway.

We get to meet some pretty cool characters, and even the villains are cool in this one. Snape is a legend, and I kind of love that he doesn't take crap from anyone, particularly not the special kid with the scar on his forehead. I have so many issues with Harry being an arrogant douchebag, so I have a little soft spot for the ones who hate him alongside me. I do appreciate his friends, though - probably more than he does. This book unites the trio pretty well, though, and I like the way they're all given their part to play.

It's a great introduction to the series, as it's quite light and full of exciting things. The writing is fairly simplistic, but that's okay here because it's a children's story. I can see why it made such a splash when it landed on shelves because it is certainly unique, but the writing honestly isn't anything special. I can forgive it here, though, because the target audience is quite young.

A decent introduction to the series, full of undulating emotions and plenty to sink your teeth into."
Renee Godding,5,Sometimes home isn’t a place. Sometimes it’s a book…
Cindy Pham,3,"This book was okay. I didn't hate it or love it either way, though towards the end I realized how lukewarm I felt about the story since I would prefer to read any other book I had on hand. I appreciate the level of novelty in the world-building during the time this was first published. The friendship between the trio is cute. Hermione and Ron are fun characters and I might have enjoyed the book more if they had been the main protagonists. Downsides: I cringed at the excessive fatphobia, anti-semitism, and the turban part. I also didn't like that the final action of the book got skipped over quickly by having a fade-to-black moment and then a lengthy explanation told by one of the side characters. It felt like such an abrupt way to end the story... but TBH, I was glad to be done with it so I could move on to other books lol."
Em Lost In Books,3,"Funny, fast and an entertaining read."
Samantha,4,Do you know how hard it is to rate these books while trying to make sure nostalgia the dominating factor??
ambsreads,5,"Despite absolutely adoring the movies and having seen them all countless times I was yet to read the books. I'm not sure why. I had time, I had the books, and I even had the motivation. But, for some reason they continuously kept getting pushed back. Now, I can finally say I've began the Harry Potter series and I love it! Without a doubt I will be reading all the books.

This book was absolutely amazing. It was great seeing new characters and characters I had always loved in different events and in new lights. I felt the movie followed the book pretty accurately, but still some scenes had me on the edge of my seat ignoring all responsibilities to know what happens!

I'm excited to further read about the trio!"
Maureen,5,"I LOVE Harry Potter, fantastic start to the series.

Reread December 2014 for #HarryXmasToYou

There are SO MANY foreshadowing things I never noticed before! Like the centaurs talking about the innocent being the first to die? And just so many things just mentioned that come up later, the dragon in Gringotts, Dittany, Sirius Black, Etc.
There's also a lot of things I've forgotten weren't in the movie, which is crazy! But so good. I love it just as much IF NOT EVEN MORE.

Reread for #HarryXmasToYou 2017

Thing I got emotional about this time because I forgot about it: Hagrid gathering pictures from people who knew Harry’s parents for the scrapbook. SO EMO. I ALSO STILL LOVE THIS BOOK. And the illustrated edition is BEAUTIFUL"
Lara,5,Do I even need to write a review?
Elyse Walters,5,"Why didn’t anyone tell me —haha —-
I can’t use that excuse —-

Harry Potter is a WIZARD......I had no idea.....
I thought he was a funny looking kid - with funny hair - and round glasses.

It’s true....HARRY POTTER is very famous. J. K. Rowling knew Harry Potter would be ‘famous’ -FOR REAL-
Hello?, with 59,157 customers reviews on Amazon - averaging 5 stars - I’d say he’s a very ‘LIKABLE’ HARRY POTTER ‘FAMOUS’ boy too!

How in the world does a first time author —- this was the first Harry Potter, book, yes? - have the vision to not only create a wizardly wonderful story centered around a neglected boy who lived in a cupboard - with his sad history- know that he
would become a hero....the world’s most famous *HARRY POTTER*? AMAZING!

Book girl -Bossy know-it- all, *Hermione*, chess player great friend *Ron*, street-smart wizardly guide *Hagrid*, father figure *Dumbledore*, etc. etc. etc...major and/or minor characters ....THEY COME ALVE! - Great Characters!

....cats, toads, owls, flying motorcycle ....muggles .....( great new word).....
....wizard boarding school...( of course — it seemed so normal -I BELIEVE)....
....food, - sausages- turkey- cake- chocolate frogs- etc. games, rewards, birthdays - Christmas - punishments, hero’s, villains, sports ( Quiddich)....such a cool game....twists and turns .....suspense
The wave of a magic wand.....HARRY POTTER sure got a magical wizardly lesson of bravery at ‘Wizard Boarding School’.

Incredible.... I honestly ‘never’ thought I’d enjoy Harry Potter, ‘this much’.
I must have been missing some marbles.

An extraordinary book for all ages .....something people have been saying FOR AGES!!!!"
Kainat(HUFFLEPUFF & PROUD),3,"No matter what anyone says I am never doubting Snape ever again. He is the best character in this entire series. He is just misunderstood. Damn you Slytherins!! They just know how to win me over.

Snape: check.
Draco: check.
Voldemort: Check check check!

Oh, i would love to know what house you guys belong to?
And NO YOU CAN'T BE IN TWO HOUSES!! That is literally just not possible.

Just took the quiz and i am a HUFFLEPUFF!
You know who else is a Hufflepuff? My new boyfriend!



WHAT??? Voldemort is afraid of Dumbledore??
Hell yeah. I am already loving this. =D

OMG OMG OMG OMG THIS IS HAPPENING! This is my first time so please no spoilers. I know i know we all have watched the movies but i don't really remember anything from this first one."
Virginia Ronan Herondale,5,"I have absolutley no idea why goodreads deleted my review AND rating but thankfully I still had it saved! So here it is again, may it stick around this time!

”It does not do to dwell on dreams and forget to live, remember that.”

Okay, here’s the thing: There are already 96.502 reviews about this book on goodreads and I think it’s safe to say that mine will carry no weight. *lol*
So I decided to make this a short “my thoughts about this book” review. ;-P

1.) ”Thirty-six,” he said, looking up at his mother and father. “That’s two less than last year.”

I totally forgot how horrible the Dursleys are and I think I kind of suppressed how dreadful Dudley is! Such a spoilt brat and this is actually putting it more than just lightly. If anyone should go to a boot camp sort of school it certainly should be him.

2.) ”Ah, go boil yer heads, both of yeh,” said Hagrid. “Harry – yer a wizard.”

Bless Hagrid for being the kind and compassionate man that he is! <3 Those lines went down in Harry Potter history and started it all! XD

3.) ”Blown up a toilet? We’ve never blown up a toilet.”
“Great idea though, thanks, Mum.”

Haha! You gotta love the Weasley twins! They might be side characters but they always manage to bring some humour into the book and they succeed to give that typical sibling and family vibe. =)

4.) ”Are you sure that’s a real spell?” said the girl. “Well, it’s not very good, is it? I’ve tried a few simple spells just for practice and it’s all worked for me.”

When I read this I totally had the Hermione of the movie in my mind. Emma Watson played her so well and I’m really glad that Hermione came off her high horse. She was really insufferable at the beginning of the book. *lol*

5.) ”You’ll soon find out some wizarding families are much better than others, Potter. You don’t want to go making friends with the wrong sort. I can help you there.”

Urgh! And so it begins! I never liked Malfoy and I’ll never do. Sorry, guys! Yes, I felt sorry for him after book 5 but he’s still a slimy little spoilt brat at the beginning of the series. Still, if his parents would have raised him differently he might have even turned out to be a nice guy. *sighs*

6.) ”Let’s try again. Potter, where would you look if I told you to find me a bezoar?”

And here comes another character I’ll never forgive. Snape is a horrible teacher and an even worse human being. There I said it. Nothing that happens over the course of the following books will change anything about the fact that he’s unfair and mean to his students! His past doesn’t excuse his actions. Still, I gotta give Rowling kudos for all the foreboding! Boy, alone the comment with the bezoar. XD And Dumbledore explaining the relationship between Snape and Harry’s father. Well done! ;-)

7.) ”But from that moment on, Hermione Granger became their friend. There are some things you can’t share without ending up liking each other, and knocking out a twelve-foot mountain troll is one of them.”

I still love that scene and I’m really glad Hermione and the others finally bonded. Also, I love that they tried to be good kids at the beginning. In the first book they actually don’t want to do anything forbidden and feel bad about it. Well, and then the other books happen. *LOL* Apparently practice makes perfect though, because they go for plenty of forbidden things but don’t get caught anymore. Haha!

8.) ”All right, all right. Flint nearly kills the Gryffindor Seeker, which could happen to anyone, I’m sure, so a penalty to Gryffindor, taken by Spinnet, who puts it away, no trouble, and we continue play, Gryffindor still in possession.”

Lee Jordan is the best! <3 He’s the main reason I enjoy the Quidditch games so much! His commentary is just funny and brilliant!

9.) ”If I get caught before I can get to the Stone, well, I’ll have to go back to the Dursleys and wait for Voldemort to find me there. It’s only dying a bit later than I would have done, because I’m never going over to the Dark Side!”

I LOVE HARRY’S DEFIANCE!!! That’s one of the many things that made me like him so much! He never backs down and always continues to fight. No matter the odds, he’s facing his troubles holding his head high! Even this early in the series you can already see that he’s going to be a great MC!

And now let’s move on and read book two! ;-)"
James Lafayette Tivendale,4,"I'm not going to review this properly as I think I'm probably the only person in the world who had never read it. I really enjoyed this awesome take on the magic school. Nice world, cool characters, the right amount of humour and kookiness, and a nice twist at the end. I devoured it within 24-hours which is always a good sign. x"
Ahmad Sharabiani ,5,"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone = Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone (Harry Potter, #1), J.K. Rowling
Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone is a fantasy novel written by British author J. K. Rowling. It is the first novel in the Harry Potter series and Rowling's debut novel, first published in 1997 by Bloomsbury. It was published in the United States as Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone by Scholastic Corporation in 1998.
The plot follows Harry Potter, a young wizard who discovers his magical heritage as he makes close friends and a few enemies in his first year at the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. With the help of his friends, Harry faces an attempted comeback by the dark wizard Lord Voldemort, who killed Harry's parents, but failed to kill Harry when he was just 15 months old."
"Khanh, first of her name, mother of bunnies ",5,"Rereading for the 3rd time for the group read.

Once upon a time, there was a 10th grader named Khanh who didn't get along with people very well. She wasn't an outcast in school, and all the bullying and teasing stopped with the commencement of high school, but she had always been a bookworm and has generally preferred the company of her own thoughts.



Lunchtime had always been dedicated not to eating, but to sitting in the library, browsing through books.

(Not to worry, she got her nutrition in 5th period in the form of a giant 6-inch M&M studded cookie and a package of Sour Patch Kids and/or a package of Reese's Pieces. Ah, the effortless metabolism of youth.)

One day, there were shiny new books on her school library's ""New Releases"" shelf. Harry Potter, books 1 through 3. She had heard of the books before, of course, since they were a constant presence on the NYT bestsellers list, but she had always avoided them, thinking of them as children's novels.

At the grand age of 14, surely she was too old for a little kid's fantasy novel. She had read the Outlander series earlier that year, after all. And it had sex in it. SEX! She didn't really quite understand everything in the book, but the point is, she had read them. Surely, at 14, Khanh was ready for more mature novels.

And that did not include Harry Potter. Harry Potter is 11. Khanh is 14. There is a vast difference in their ages. Khanh was a teenager, dammit.

But the Harry Potter books were new. Brand new. They were shiny, they had never been touched by another reader. And Khanh was tempted.

She picked up the first book in the series: Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone.

The end.

Or rather, the beginning."
