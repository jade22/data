Lora ,4,"""It is our choices, Harry, that show what we truly are, far more than our abilities."" - Albus Dumbledore

Such a wise wizard.

You know how sometimes when you read the first in a series and it turns out so much better than you originally anticipated, it makes you a little apprehensive when starting the sequel? Well, I felt that way before starting this, but I can definitely say that Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is another fabulous installment in the rightfully beloved Harry Potter series!
And while I will admit to not loving it quite as much as its predecessor, I still enjoyed it a great deal.
I think the reason for my not liking it as much can be mostly credited to the introduction of a new character, Professor Lockhart. Lockhart is an annoyingly pretentious wizard who is completely full of himself, and the majority of his teachings were based on his own life and his supposed brushes with death that he escaped only because of his ""heroism"" and great knowledge of the magic arts. (view spoiler)
In a summary, I didn't find the story involving Lockhart quite as interesting as Harry's realization of his true abilities and the escapades of his first year at Hogwarts.

But HP II undoubtedly still has plenty of hilarious moments and magical wonders - not to mention the lovely cast of characters - to more than compensate for this particular installment's slightly lacking plot. Hence the five stars. :)

FAVORITE QUOTE: ""I've heard you hate those Muggles you live with,"" said Ernie swiftly.
""It's not possible to live with the Dursleys and not hate them,"" said Harry. ""I'd like to see you try it.""

Next up is Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, and I'm very much looking forward to it.

My reviews of other titles in this series:

Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"
Zoë ,5,"“It is our choices, Harry, that show what we truly are, far more than our abilities.” CHILLS.

(REREAD)

Okay DUH 5/5 stars. I actually liked this book more than I remembered! This used to be my least favorite of the Harry Potter books and, while that still might be true, I was more entertained than I expected! I always forget how different Book Ginny is from Movie Ginny (way better all around) and how she has such a bigger role in the books than the films.

NOW ONTO HP AND THE PRISONER OF AZKABAN! "
Sasha Alsberg ,5,"JK Rowling really knows how to write a great book, thats for sure! Although this wasn't my favorite book in the series, it definitely wasn't because it was bad. I loved the plot and conflict, even though it wasn't as intense as the others were. I was definitely shocked at the end...so epic and mind blowing!"
Jayson,4,"(A-) 83% | Very Good
Notes: A clever conjuration, it's a cozy castle mystery, a creature-fest, and Ripper-esque: lit by monsters, ghosts, and history."
Amanda Patterson ,1,I have nothing to say.
Stephanie ,1,After trying to read this book I couln't read anymore...I just wasn't into it at all...
Melanie,1,"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is definitely not one of Rowling's best works. It seems that she wanted to write something that would follow the footsteps and carry the success of The Sorcerer's Stone but she failed miserably at that. The first half of the book is almost a summary of the first book as though Rowling is trying to remind the reader what the original story is and where Harry came from, making the book quite redundant. It is not until the last 50 pages that the story picks up momentum and actually becomes interesting.

Through it all, Rowling, like always, remains a talented story teller. But one that is trying too hard to remind us about the first book. This book draws strengths from her writing style and less from her imagination, as thou she is not confident enough in the story and afraid of not reaching the success of the first book."
Nina,3,"It's Harry Potter, it just had to be a good book and it definitely is!

2018 REREAD: I must say that I didn’t enjoy this book as much as I apparently enjoyed it the other God knows how many times I’ve read it in my life which is why I decided to change my rating from 4 to 3 stars. Personally, I just think this book is a lot less interesting that the other books from this series and just can’t keep up with them. Also, the scene in which Harry and Ron steal the car is still one of the most frustrating scenes from the entire series and always makes me want to throw the book at a wall."
Krystal ,2,"I stand by my original 2-star rating for this one; it's one of the weakest of the series.

It goes for the same light tone as the first, but most of the magic is kind of a rehash from the first book, so it's lost some of its appeal. Then there's the darker theme of, well, racism, really, in the form of musings over the 'purity' of magic families. Pretty heavy stuff for a kids book, and not nearly as much fun as the first.

Lockhart is a doofus, and it's painful and offensive how EVERY woman in this book throws herself at him. It's particularly grating that Hermione gets on board with it - she's supposed to be the smart one. There really needed to be a female character that saw through his bs like the boys did. I know he's supposed to lighten the tone, but it was rather exaggerated. Appropriate for a kid's book, but it's going to lose the older audience a little.

Once again, the teachers are basically useless, an Dumbledore stands by and lets Harry fight his battles for him again. Harry is his typical arrogant self, once again believing he's solely responsible for fixing things. Ron gets reluctantly dragged along, making my appreciation for him and his grumblings grow. Hermione is much more fun with her rule-breaking - she must have really loosened up over the break because she's chill AF about doing the wrong thing. Snape is in fine form, particularly paired up with Lockhart, because Snape just does not have time for your sh*t and it brings out the sarcasm that I love so much. His loyalty for Dumbledore doesn't exactly shine through, though, and it bothers me that he's so chummy with Malfoy. Malfoy's a total weasel and Snape should be too old and wise to fall for that crap. Dobby is the most annoying character ever invented and rivaled only by that giant floppy-eared rabbit thing from the Star Wars prequel movies. The twins are solid amusement, but poorly utilised in this book.

I disliked the way Harry treated Colin, and Myrtle, and Nick ... like he kind of pretends like he doesn't think he's better than anyone but he also seems to think that what he wants and needs is far more important than what anyone else wants and needs. Again, this is me struggling to deal with children. I get that they're kids, but someone needs to sit Harry's ass down and explain to him how to respect other people. He's got a bit of that Dursley jerk factor in him, whether he likes it or not.

The whole Chamber of Secrets mystery is curious, but a bit underwhelming. It's pretty slow, and the book doesn't really start to get exciting until the last quarter. Shame, really, after such a great introduction to the world in the first one.

It was an easy enough read, and there's still plenty of magic and unusual happenings, but overall it's pretty weak compared to the first one. Lots of dumb, illogical ideas and conclusions, meaning it all kind of crumbles under scrutiny. Understandably enjoyable to the younger readers, though."
Cindy Pham,3,"This was a cute middle grade book. Even though it was slow, I liked it a little more than the first book since at this point the world has already been established and now we get to see more of the characters and the setting. Ron and his family, especially the twins, are endearing. I also thought it was interesting seeing Harry’s internal struggle with whether he was truly Gryffindor or Slytherin, and the payoff later on about how it is our choices that show what we truly are. I didn’t like how the mystery was conveniently solved, the monologue of explanation from the villain at the end, and how Hermione was literally petrified throughout most of the book just so that she wouldn’t have figured everything out right away. But I’m glad to finally be done with this book so that, just like Dobby, I am free."
Em Lost In Books,3,"3.5*

definitely liked it better than first book. loved the bickering among the trio, and their friendship has gotten deeper, so are their characters."
Virginia Ronan Herondale,5,"”It is our choices, Harry, that show what we truly are, far more than our abilities.”

And here I go with another one of my short “My thoughts about this book” reviews. I can’t believe that I forgot so many things. Like for instance the fact that Dumbledore actually was a Transfiguration teacher before he became headmaster. Kinda suitable that this is McGonagall’s role now. ;-)

1.) ”Harry Potter asks if he can help Dobby … Dobby has heard of your greatness, sir, but of your goodness, Dobby never knew…”

Aww Dobby! It was so good to see him again! He’s really one of the best HP characters ever and this even though he made it kind of tough to like him. *lol* Well, at least at the beginning. Poor Harry! XD

2.) ”Your sons flew that car to Harry’s house and back last night!” shouted Mrs Weasley. “What have you got to say about that, eh?”
“Did you really?” said Mr Weasley eagerly. “Did it go all right? I-I mean,” he faltered, as sparks flew from Mrs Weasley’s eyes, “that-that was very wrong, boys – very wrong indeed …”

I’ll always love how Mr Weasley is more interested in finding out if the car flew well than in his kids actually flying the car! *lol* Also Molly Weasley giving him hell for not reacting the way a responsible parent is supposed to is just epic! Haha! Those two. You can see they have a great marriage! ;-P

3.) ”Mr Weasley had a cut lip and Mr Malfoy had been hit in the eye by an Encyclopedia of Toadstools.”

How could I forget that Mr Weasley threw himself at Malfoy? One of the best things in this book ever! Not that I support violence (I’m a pacifist) but even I can’t help appreciating that Lucius Malfoy for once, actually had his ass handed to him. XD

4.) ”That vanishing cabinet was extremely valuable!” he was saying gleefully to Mrs Norris. “We’ll have Peeves out this time, my sweet.”

How come I never noticed this before?! The foreboding!!! OMG! Like damn, there are so many things that are mentioned only briefly and rather casually and then when you continue to read the series they reappear with a vengeance! O_o With every book I read I’m more and more awed by J.K Rowling’s genius!

5.) ”Homework: compose a poem about my defeat of the Wagga Wagga werewolf! Signed copies of Magical Me to the author of the best one!”

Gilderoy Lockhart is so full of himself! I swear he must have been the worst DADA teacher they ever had. And they had many over the years which even Dumbledore can’t deny. Loved that bit at the ending when he said he’d have to write an ad because they “seem to run through them”. *lol*

6.) ”You are Muggle-born?”
“Half-blood, sir,” said Riddle. “Muggle father, witch mother.”

There definitely was a history lesson hidden in there. It’s fascinating how Riddle of all people could be a half-blood and then go against Muggle born wizards! I’m sure J.K. Rowling thought about World War II when she wrote this, because all the pure-blood and half-blood etc. stuff reminds me of a very dark chapter in German history… >_<

7.) ”But why’s she got to go to the library?”
“Because that’s what Hermione does,” said Ron, shrugging. “When in doubt, go to the library.”

Did anyone notice how well Ron knows Hermione? And how often he defended her in this book? I mean he actually would have fought Malfoy with his bare hands if Harry and Dean would have allowed it! It’s so obvious that Ron cares about her deeply! To vomit snails without complaining about it should count as the ultimate indication of eternal love and affection! *LOL*

8.) ”Of course,” she said, and Harry, amazed, saw a tear glistening in her beady eye.

McGonagall losing it was another great moment in this book! When you least expect it she always shows some kindness and heart and to be honest this never ceases to amaze me! XD She’s a great teacher and I’m not surprised that she always takes over when Dumbledore isn’t around.

9.) ”You’re in luck,” said Harry, forcing Lockhart to his feet at wandpoint. “We think we know where it is. And what’s inside it. Let’s go.”

I just love Harry, okay?! *lol* For such a young kid he certainly has a lot of guts and courage! The way he dealt with Lockhart? I think not even an adult wizard could have done it any better. XD The sheer audacity to demand aid from him like that. YES! Haha! <3

10.) (view spoiler)

I can’t wait to read “The Prisoner of Azkaban”! I’m afraid it might have to wait until next year though! So many books, so little time! ;-)

______________________________

As always I loved this! <3
And boy there were so many hints! The foreboding is real in this one! *lol*
Also I kinda like that every book ends with the school year and that there’s no cliff-hanger! I never thought about this but HP is so successful and this even though there are never cliff-hangers. XD (Well, at least not in the strict sense...)
Must be magic! ;-P
______________________________

I’m already reading 6 books,
BUT
this is Harry Potter
and it’s autumn
close to Halloween
and I just need another comfort read? *lol*

Plus 2 of my six books will be finished soon so this means that I’ll be down to 5 again which is my usual amount. XD

Look at me being all reasonable and responsible. Haha! ;-P

But honestly, do I even need a reason to read Harry Potter?
No, HP can be read anytime! =))"
Kayla Dawn ,4,"I do not really like J.K. Rowling, Harry himself is absolutely useless and can't do anything on his own, this school is way too dangerous for little children and Qudditch rules don't make any sense what so ever but maaaan these books are entertaining and just make me feel some happy feelings.


Ps: Isn't it kind of fucked up that there is a house that basically sets children up to become assholes?
Rowling definitely was too biased to make a realistic school system."
Katherine Elizabeth,4,"After Re-Reading:
4/5 Stars

This one isn't as good as the first one, and I'm going to keep my rating the same as it was before. It felt as though the writing wasn't as passionate as the first novel - I've heard I'm not the only one who thinks this - so no one throw things at me!

Either way, it's still Harry Potter, so of course it's naturally amazing and wonderful. None of these books are bad. Just some are better than others!"
"Khanh, first of her name, mother of bunnies ",5,"I love this book, of course I do, but the fact remains that this book prominently featured two of my most hated Harry Potter characters. Ginny Weasley and Dobby. There, I said it. I hate them both. In my Harry Potter hate list, Ginny and Dobby probably rank somewhere below Umbridge and Peter Pettigrew. Yeah, you heard me. I hate them that much.

The reason I hate Ginny is---well, never mind. I don't want to start another shipping war here, the last one was terrible enough, so let the reason for my hatred be implicit and unsaid.

Dobby is freaking annoying, yo. All his eagerness and shit - and yeah, I know what happens in the end. Doesn't matter. I still hate Dobby. Dobby is the equivalent of fingernails on chalkboard for me. If he had been my elf, I'd have given him a sock already so he could his whimpering, sniveling ass out of my life. He means well, I know he does, it's just that he's such a frustratingly well-meaning bumbling idiot.
“You know what, Harry? If he doesn’t stop trying to save your life he’s going to kill you.”
Aaaaaaaand one final note.
“Ginny!” said Mr. Weasley, flabbergasted. “Haven’t I taught you anything. What have I always told you? Never trust anything that can think for itself if you can’t see where it keeps its brain?""
No particular reason I included that, except for the fact that it reminded me of my ex-boyfriend :3"
Lara,5,"“Well, you're expelling us aren't you?"" said Ron.
""Not today, Mr. Weasley.""
Snape looked as though Christmas had been canceled.”

I love Snape I love Ron and I love these books and damn I wish I didn't know alot of spoilers even though I haven't watched the movies."

FIRST REVIEW

Absolutely loved Chamber of Secrets! I will forever adore the Weasley twins.

EDIT: wow, Amber what a great review. But, I am now the owner of the illustrated version - not sure how to add that but oh well. I own it and it's good."
Samantha,5,"Reading HP to ring in the new year may be a new tradition of mine, since I've done just that two years in a row.

I haven't read this book since the first time I read it in 5th grade, but I loved it! I never would have thought before that CoS was one of my favorites from the series but I stand corrected."
Ahmad Sharabiani ,5,"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, J.K. Rowling
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, is a fantasy novel written by British author J.K. Rowling, and the second novel in the Harry Potter series. The plot follows Harry's second year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, during which a series of messages on the walls of the school's corridors warn that the ""Chamber of Secrets"" has been opened and that the ""heir of Slytherin"" would kill all pupils who do not come from all-magical families. These threats are found after attacks which leave residents of the school ""petrified"" (frozen like stone). Throughout the year, Harry and his friends Ron and Hermione investigate the attacks. The book was published in the United Kingdom on 2 July 1998 by Bloomsbury and later, in the United States on 2 June 1999 by Scholastic Inc."
Renee Godding,5,"This was always my least favourite Harry Potter book when I was a child, yet somehow over the last years I’ve been starting to love it more and more.
The fact that it has Lockeheart, who is low-key hilarious as a character, and Fawkes who is still my fantasy pet does help with my appreciation for it, I guess. ;)"
Elyse Walters,5,"Thank you Lisa!!!!!

Ok.... Finished book 2! I’ve definitely entered POTTER WORLD.
I enjoyed it ... but I don’t think this was as strong as the first book. It ‘feels’ like a transition book...

I loved Ginny - and Harry’s relationship developing with her...
Ron- and the gang - and their dialogue is wonderful—
Sandwich plates that re-build themselves. ( ha— only in Wizard-land ) — love it!

Summer break for Harry ...
Back to Wizard School in Sept."
Maureen,5,Reread this for #HarryXmasToYou 2017 and I always notice new and different things while reading. love it!!!
James Lafayette Tivendale,4,"When everyone first read and loved Harry Potter I ignored it. Not for any particular reason but about 10 years ago I didn't think I would be into it. Fast forward a decade and I'm now working my way through what I can say already is a children's classic fantasy series that is up there with The Wizard of Oz and The Chronicles of Narnia.

Harry's existence with his Muggle uncle and auntie is as horrible as ever and he can't wait to get back to Hogwarts after speaking to a mini-elf masochist who essentially predicts his doom and travelling in an awesome magic-infused flying car. Upon returning to Hogwarts it's similar to before, Quidditch lessons, Malfoy being a bit of a tosser, Hermainie loving studying, and the wizarding threesome getting into all sorts of nonsensical antics. A new tutor is introduced this time, Professor Lockhart and I thought he was brilliant mainly due to how awful he was with his tall-tales and celebrity status! This narrative is brimming with ghosts, boys and girls who adore Harry, spiders, and Professor Sprout. The characters are pretty brilliant and I can easily understand why this is adored globally. I didn't need the continuous info-dumps that reminded me what happened in book one but apart from that there isn't really anything negative to say. The ending was surprising with a cool twist, a magic hat, a phoenix, a sword, a diary, and a giant snake. I hope you don't tell me off for these spoilers as I'm sure I'm the only fantasy book reviewer who hasn't read these yet. I'm loving the adventure so far. These books are what I go to for now when I want no-nonsense, uncomplex awesomeness. Love it."
