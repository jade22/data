I'm like ok I guess they're trying to condense the web traffic. It was no big deal until now since I can't complete a pickup order without having to call in and place it through customer service because the app intentionally empties out my cart. I go to checkout it says not available for delivery..... uh im picking up the items. So I take the item off to continue then another item pops up before its done i barely have anything.,1,5,20.33,2020-08-31 08:26:45,,

Again, especially during a pandemic when you want people to know exactly where they need to go so they can get in and out faster.

I used to get both an email and a text advising me that my order was ready for pick up. I would drive to my store, and using the link that they provided in the email or the text msg, I could go to the browser on my phone and sign in when I had arrived at the store. That process would notify the staff to bring my groceries out to me. Worked every time. Now, the email or text link opens this worthless app. I shop once a week, and it's only worked properly once or twice. Almost every week the app needs to be updated before it will open, so I am sitting there in the pick up lot waiting on that process. When it's done, it then takes me to the welcome to Walmart shopping page so I can place a new order, not to the page where I can notify them that I have arrived and they can now bring my current order out to me. There is no info on that page as to get to the sign in for pick up process, nor can I find it when looking through the menu. I have tried deleting the app, but then the link takes me here to the Google Store to install the app all over again in order to proceed, instead of allowing me to use my browser like I used to be able to. So, I end up having to call the grocery pick up department to tell them that I have arrived and they can bring my groceries out to me. That's ok by me, but I know that doesn't work for them as they have their hand held electronic units with them that should automatically notify them via the internet that I have arrived. BUT NO, they have to run over and answer the phone because this stupid app doesn't work.
